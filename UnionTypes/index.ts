// !! Union Types !!

// Union types allow us to give a few different possible types. If the eventual value's type is included, TS will be happy :).

// We can create a union type by using the single | (pipe character) to separate the types we want to include. It's like saying, "This thing is allowed to be this, this, or this". TS will enforce it from there.
