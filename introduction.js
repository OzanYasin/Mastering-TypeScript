// TypeScript Overview

// Static Checking
// TypeScript detects errors in our code without running it.
// This is called static checking.

// Type Checking
// TypeScript does this error checking on the basis of the "kinds of data" in our program AKA types.

// Why Types?
// - Helps us find errors!
// - Analyzes our code as we type
// - Only exist in development

// It's a superset of JavaScript, meaning that everything in JavaScript is valid in TypeScript.

// Plus a bunch of extra syntax that is TypeScript specific, that has to do with types.
