// Working with the DOM
// TypeScript does know about the document, it does know about DOM elements and all the different element types and add event listener and query selector.
// document -> type definition, it's shown every type of document object.
// * There is an option to turn that off.
// (if not working with the DOM)
// For example, you might want to work with Node. In that case you have no use for any of this defined document type stuff.
// !! Lib !!
// TypeScript includes a default set of type definitions for built-in JS APIs (like Math), as well as type definitions for things found in browser environments (like document).
